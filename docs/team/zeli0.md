### Project: Reroll

Reroll is a **desktop app for managing tabletop RPG character, monster and item sheets, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Reroll
can get your entity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Old Feature**: Added backbone for addEntityCommand
    * Essentially made part of the backbone of one of the core features of Reroll, being the feature to add new entities(Pull Request [\#53](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/53))

* **New Feature**: Added inventory command
    * What it does: allows the user add items to characters and mobs so that they can use them in-game.
    * Justification: Inventory is a critical part of TTRPGs, allowing players to use and wield different items. Implementing it is crucial for the product to be fully functional.
    * PRs: [\#111](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/111), [\#113](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/113), [\#114](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/114)

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Zeli0&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17)

* **Test Cases**: Converted backbone of all the test cases orignally mapped to AddressBook over to the new Reroll format. (Pull Request: [\#76](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/76))

* **Project management**:
    * Cleaned up most of the old code related to the AddressBook base that Reroll was based off of (Pull Requests: [\#185](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/185))

* **Team-based tasks**
    * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Fixed error messages relating to certain commands in `edit value`(Pull Request: [\#200](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/200))

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the feature `edit value` and the specifics about `fields` in that command [\#200](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/200)
        * Added images to help with users understanding how to use commands (Pull Request: [\#217](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/217))

* **Community**:
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [\#149](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/issues/149), [\#127](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/issues/127), [\#150](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/issues/150), [\#120](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/issues/120))
