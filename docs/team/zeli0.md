### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Old Feature**: Added backbone for addEntityCommand
    * Essentially made part of the backbone of one of the core features of Reroll, being the feature to add new entities(Pull Request [\#53](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/53))

* **New Feature**: Added inventory command
    * What it does: allows the user add items to characters and mobs so that they can use them in-game.
    * Justification: Inventory is a critical part of TTRPGs, allowing players to use and wield different items. Implementing it is crucial for the product to be fully functional.
    * PRs: [\#111](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/111), [\#113](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/113), [\#114](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/114)

* **Test Cases**: Converted backbone of all the test cases orignally mapped to AddressBook over to the new Reroll format. (Pull Request: [\#76](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/76))

* **Project management**:
    * Cleaned up most of the old code related to the AddressBook base that Reroll was based off of (Pull Requests: [\#185](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/185))

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Fixed error messages relating to certain commands in `edit value`(Pull Request: [\#200](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/200))

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the feature `edit value` and the specifics about `fields` in that command [\#200](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/200)
        * Added images to help with users understanding how to use commands (Pull Request: [\#217](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/pull/217))
