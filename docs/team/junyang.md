### Project: Reroll

Reroll is a desktop app for managing tabletop RPG character, monster and item sheets, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Reroll can get your entity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list according to a classification
  * What it does: Allows the user to list all entities of a given classification type
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user should show lists of entities as per their needs and the app should provide a convenient way to show them.
  * Highlights: Able to list out all the items, mobs, characters or all entities currently save in Reroll.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter according to a list of tags
  * What it does: allows the user to filter all entities according to a list of tags
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user should filter entities according to tags as per their needs and the app should provide a convenient way to filter them.
  * Highlights: Able to filter all items, mobs and characters according to a list of tags. The feature also works additively with the list command, so it is possible to list all mobs of a given set of tags. The implementation too was challenging as it required chaining of different commands to work.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to clear entities
  * What it does: allows the user to clear all entities or currently selected entities
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user should have access to a way to delete more than 1 entity at a time as per the user's needs and the app should provide a convenient way to delete them.
  * Highlights: Able to clear all entities or currently selected entities
