### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `list`.

<img src="images/RerollArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />
<img src="images/RerollStorageSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

Each of the main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/RerollUiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ViewModePanel`
, `EditModePanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart`
class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Entity` objects residing in the `Model`.

The `ListModePanel` and `ViewModePanel` are UI elements that contain the necessary components to display the regular
operating mode and the view / edit mode of Reroll respectively. Upon being triggered by the appropriate
`CommandResult`, the `UI` switches modes through `SwitchUiMode`, unparenting the previous (`ListModePanel` by default),
and parenting the alternative panel to `MainWindow`.

![Sequence flow of switching to Edit Mode](images/RerollEditModeSequenceDiagram.png)

This is to create a seamless transition for the user and to free up screen real estate when not in view / edit mode.
`ViewModePanel` contains a `EntityDetailsPanel`, which fetches entity data from `Model` after every command executed in
edit mode to ensure that the user is kept up to date with changes.

### Logic component

**
API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` or `EditModeParser` class to parse
   the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a entity).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<img src="images/RerollLogicActivityDiagram.png" width="600"/>

`Logic` keeps a boolean `isInEditMode` as runtime state that determines which of `AddressBookParser`
and `EditModeParser`
to use for incoming commands. `EditModeParser` differs in that it treats all user input as a `EditValueCommand`, which
allows us to simplify the syntax for that command to simply `<FIELD> <VALUE>` as opposed to `<COMMAND> <FIELD> <VALUE>`.
This is done to smoothen the experience for the end user, who might need to edit many fields in a short period of time.

### Model component

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/experimental/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/RerollModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores Reroll data i.e., all `Entity` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEntityList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Entity` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

**Note:** `RerollAllEntities`, the class which stores all entities, is abstracted from `Reroll`, to support future
functionality outside of entity list manipulation.

### Storage component

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/experimental/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/RerollStorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both Reroll data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RerollStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Entities

![Entities in Reroll](images/RerollEntityClassDiagram.png)

In order to facilitate operations and management of various aspects of user data, we have split entities into 3 classes
implementing the `Entity` interface.

Each class holds their own the classification-specific fields while exposing the data for the `Ui` thru the interface
method `getFields`.

#### Inventory

Characters and Mobs in Reroll contain an `Inventory`, which can contain references to up to any number of `Item`s. Do
note that these `Item` are added to the inventory as a immutable copy of the item when the `inventory add` command is
used in edit mode.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Make entity feature

#### Design considerations

In Reroll, there are 3 different entity classes (`Character`, `Mob`, `Item`) that users can keep track of. Each class
has a set of unique fields to keep track of, resulting in a combined number of ~15 fields to keep track of. Thus, it is
important to minimize mental load on the user during the creation of new entities.

#### Alternative approaches

1. **Current design**: Minimal make command with new syntax \
   Sample command: `make char King Arthur` - makes a new Character that has the name _King Arthur_ \
   This approach only allows users to create an entity with a given name, all other fields can only be filled in using
   the `edit` command. This allows users to create entities quickly by eliminating the need to input prefixes.
2. Alternative: Reuse AB3 syntax, allow user to enter all fields at once \
   Sample command: `make char n/King Arthur str/10 dex/5 int/3 ...` - makes a new Character with all the specified
   fields\
   This approach allows users to create detailed entities with just one command. However, usage of prefixes such as `n/`
   increases the mental load on the user to keep track of all the different prefixes, and increases their chance of
   making mistakes while inputting commands.

#### [Proposed extension]

Allow short-form syntax like `m c King Arthur`

#### To add: UML Diagrams

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entity in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new entity. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the entity was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the entity being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

The user stories are not limited to those in this list. More can be added in the future as new features are developed.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Reroll` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: Edit an entity**

**MSS**

1. User request to enter edit mode for specified entity
2. Reroll enters edit mode
3. User requests to replace specified field with new value
4. Reroll edits the specified entity and display it

   Steps 3-4 are repeated for as many fields as required.
5. User exits edit mode

   Use case ends

**Extensions**

* 2a. The specifications of the entity are invalid
    * 2a1. Reroll shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 1
* 3a. The given fields are invalid
    * 3a.1 Reroll shows an error message and exits edit mode

      Use case resumes at step 1

**Use case: Add item to inventory of entity**

**MSS**

1. User request to enter edit mode for specified entity
2. Reroll enters edit mode
3. User request to add specified item
4. Reroll adds specified item to entity's inventory

   Use case ends

**Extensions**

* 2a. The specifications of the entity are invalid
    * 2a1. Reroll shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 1
* 3a. Item does not exist in Reroll
    * 3a1. Reroll shows an error message and exits edit mode

      Use case resumes at step 1

*{More to be added}*

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 500 _entities_ without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The application is not required to be compatible with any existing tracking applications.
5. The application should be usable by new players not familiar with RPG trackers.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Entities**: General term for __characters__, _mobs_ and _items_
* **Characters**: Characters, typically humans, that are controlled by players participating in a table-top RPG game
* **Mobs**: Non-player characters (NPCS) that are typically monsters
* **Items**: Weapons, armor or tools that players can keep and use

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Future enhancements are planned to improve Reroll.

1. Currently, fields such as weight, cost and challenge rating accepts negative values. Parser will be updated to detect
   such invalid values and print an error message.
2. More case-insensitive commands will be implemented. Currently [CLASSIFICATION] must be in lowercase to work, causing
   confusion among the testers.
3. Entities with very long name does not wrap in the GUI. Changes to GUI to remedy this is expected.

--------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a entity

1. Deleting a entity while all entities are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all entities using the `list` command. Multiple entities in the list.

    2. Test case: `delete char Mike`<br>
       Expected: The character named Mike is deleted from Reroll. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status
       message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    3. Test case: `delete item Does Not Exist`<br>
       Expected: No entity is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` where x is not char, item or mob<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.
