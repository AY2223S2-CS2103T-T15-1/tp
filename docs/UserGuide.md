Reroll is a **desktop app for managing tabletop RPG character, monster and item sheets, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Reroll
can get your entity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* Table of Contents {:toc}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `reroll.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases/).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Reroll.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar reroll.jar` command to
   run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui.png](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `make char John Cena` : Adds a character sheet named `John Cena` to the database.

    * `edit char John Cena` : Enters edit mode for a character named `John Cena`.

    * `delete char John Cena` : Deletes previously created character `John Cena`.

    * `list char` : Displays a list of all character entities.

    * `template orc John Cena`: Create a character sheet named `John Cena` based on a pre-existing character template
      called `orc`.

    * `clear all` : Deletes all entity sheets.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Important Terms

## Entity classifications

There are 3 different entity classifications in Reroll, each with their own set of fields to track.

`Character` or `char` in short refers to characters whose actions are controlled by players instead of the game master.

`Mob` refers to hostile non-playable characters which are controlled by the game master, meant to be defeated by player
characters.

`Item` refers to equipment such as armour, and miscellaneous tools. These are mainly dropped by mobs and can be used by
the player characters.

## Entity Fields

This is a definitive list of the different fields each entity has:

| Character    | Mob              | Item   |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| Name         | Name             | Name   |
| Strength     | Strength         | Cost   |
| Dexterity    | Dexterity        | Weight |
| Intelligence | Intelligence     | Tags   |
| Level        | Challenge Rating |        |
| XP           | Legendary        |        |
| Tags         | Tags             |        |
| Inventory    | Inventory        |        |

Each field accepts a certain type of value and has a number of command terms, as seen below:

| Field            | Command Term          | Value Type           |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Name             | name                  | Alphanumeric String  |
| Strength         | strength, str         | `int`                |
| Dexterity        | dexterity, dex        | `int`                |
| Intelligence     | intelligence          | `int`                |
| Level            | level                 | `int`                |
| XP               | exp, xp               | `int`                |
| Challenge Rating | challengerating, cr   | `float`              |
| Legendary        | isLegendary, legend   | true / false         |
| Tags             | tags, tag             | Alphanumeric Strings |
| Inventory        | inventory             | Items                |

These values come predefined when an entity is created, and if you want the fields to have different values, then you
can edit them later in the edit command, which will be mentioned later.

Fill in one of the field's command terms into where the command says to fill in `FIELD` to edit the corresponding field.

Here's a general breakdown of what each field means:

`Name` is the name of the entity, be it the name of a character, or the name of a mob like a gargoyle.

`Strength` is a numerical measure of the physical force that an entity can exert. This then measures actions like if the
entity is capable of carrying heavy items, or interacting in scenarios that require lots of physical strength.

`Dexterity` is a numerical measure of physical prowess, mostly related to aspects like agility, reflexes and how fast
the entity can move. Like strength, this determines the choices and outcomes of certain events in the game.

`Intelligence` is a numerical measure of magical and fantastical knowledge, often used to determine if an entity is able
to wield certain spells, use certain magic items, or decipher foreign languages.

`Level` is the numerical measure of the current stage of capability of a character. This increases by one after a
certain number of XP points are gained, and usually characters get to increase their stats when they level up.

`XP` stands for Experience Points, which are points gained when a character defeats a mob, or completes quests. These
help the character level up.

`Challenge Rating` is a total numerical score used to judge mob. based on a number of different stats. The higher the
rating, the more difficult it is to fight the mob.

`Legendary` is a boolean value denoting if a mob is legendary, which allows them to have special Legendary Resistances
or Legendary Actions that normal mobs do not have.

`Tags` are string values used to label entities with extra information you might want to, like if a fish is tasty.

`Inventory` is a list of items that mobs and characters have, basically denoting what items they have on hand currently
and can use. Records the total value of every item in the inventory.

## Templates

`Template` refers to pre-determined characters that can be used to quickly generate characters with a preferred stat
distribution. Templates are pre-determined and cannot be created/edited/deleted by the user.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `make CLASSIFICATION NAME`, `CLASSIFICATION` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used
  as `add item gilded dagger`.

* CLASSIFICATION can be the following: .<br>
  Item: `item`, Monster:`mob`, Character: `char`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` or `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Entities in Reroll are identified by classification and name. Entities with the same name but different classification
  are valid.

* After creation, entities are modified via the edit mode.
