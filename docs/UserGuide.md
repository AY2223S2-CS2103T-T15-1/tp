Reroll is a **desktop app for managing tabletop RPG character, monster and item sheets, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Reroll can get your entity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `reroll.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases/).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Reroll.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar reroll.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `make char John Cena` : Adds a character sheet named `John Cena` to the database.
   
   * `edit char John Cena` : Enters edit mode for a character named `John Cena`.

   * `delete char John Cena` : Deletes previously created character `John Cena`.

   * `list char` : Displays a list of all character entities.
   
   * `template Wrestler John Cena`: Create a character sheet named `John Cena` based on 
   a pre-existing character template called `Wrestler`.
   
   * `clear` : Deletes all entity sheets.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `make CLASSIFICATION NAME`, `CLASSIFICATION` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add item gilded dagger`.

* CLASSIFICATION can be the following: .<br>
  Item: `item`, Monster:`mob`, Character: `char`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## Entity classifications
There are 3 different entity classifications in Reroll, each with their own set of fields to track.

`Character` or `char` in short refers to characters whose actions are controlled by players instead of the game master.

`Mob` refers to hostile non-playable characters which are controlled by the game master, 
meant to be defeated by player characters.

`Item` refers to equipment such as armour, and miscellaneous tools. These are mainly dropped by mobs and 
can be used by the player characters.

The definitive list of the different values each entity has:

| Character  | Mob              | Item   |
|----------------------|------------------|--------|
| Name                 | Name             | Name   | 
| Strength             | Strength         | Cost   |
| Dexterity            | Dexterity        | Weight | 
| Intelligence         | Intelligence     | Tags   |
| Level                | Challenge Rating |        |
| XP                   | Legendary        |        |
| Tags                 | Tags             |        |

## Templates

`Template` refers to pre-determined characters that can be used to quickly generate characters 
with a preferred stat distribution. Templates are pre-determined and cannot be created/edited/deleted by the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Short-form commands

To aid expert users, commonly used commands and fields have short-form variants that can be used instead.

| Reference | Full | Short-form |
| - | - | - |
| Make command | make | m |
| Edit command | edit | e |
| Delete command | delete | d |
| List command | list | l |
| Character | char | c |
| Mob | mob | m |
| Item | item | i |
| Template command | template | t |
| Strength | strength | s |
| Dexterity | dexterity | d |
| Level | level | lvl |
| Name | name | n |
| Tags | tags | t | 
| Inventory | inventory | inv |
